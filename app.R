                 ourselves but also for dedicated professionals, including veterinarians.
                 The intricacies involve diverse drug tiers, various classes of bacteria,

                  The naive Bayes classifier is particularly adept for this scenario, as it proficiently calculates the likelihood or probability of a bacterium's presence.
                  Our assumption is that the occurrence of a pathogen is unrelated to both the month and the species of the pet in question.
                    Alternatively, logistic regression could be employed to ascertain the presence of specific bacteria across different months.

                    Our community partner's data encompasses over 200 distinct bacteria, and the model is expected to calculate probabilities for each type of bacteria, given the independent variables.
                    In this context, a multinomial logistic regression model is highly appropriate.
                    Multinomial logistic regression is ideally suited for predicting dependent variables that fall into more than two categories.
                    These models are versatile, as they can handle both qualitative and quantitative independent variables.
                    A significant advantage of this approach is the lack of a requirement for normality in the training data.

                    These variables are categorical, making them well-suited for the multinomial Naive Bayes model.
                    This method is also advantageous for handling high-dimensional data, which is relevant here due to the extensive variety of bacteria and antibiotics in the dataset.
